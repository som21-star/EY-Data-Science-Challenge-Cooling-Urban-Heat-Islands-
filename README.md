This repository contains my submission for the 2025 EY Open Science AI &amp; Data Challenge. The challenge focused on building a machine learning model to predict Urban Heat Island (UHI) index values across urban areas based on geospatial data (latitude, longitude) collected from the Bronx and Manhattan regions in NYC.

🧠 EY Open Science AI & Data Challenge 2025 — Urban Heat Island (UHI) Prediction
This repository contains my submission for the 2025 EY Open Science AI & Data Challenge. The challenge focused on building a machine learning model to predict Urban Heat Island (UHI) index values across urban areas based on geospatial data (latitude, longitude) collected from the Bronx and Manhattan regions in NYC.

🌡 Problem Statement
Urban Heat Islands are areas with significantly higher temperatures than their rural surroundings, primarily due to urbanization. The goal was to develop a regression model that predicts UHI Index values and identifies key contributing factors.

🚀 Approach
I explored multiple models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. After experimentation and performance tuning, the final model selected was the H2O AutoML framework, which achieved a 96% R² score on the test set.

✅ Key Highlights
Data pre-processing and geospatial handling

Model comparison using R² and RMSE

Feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of urban heat

Final model: H2O with 0.96 R² performance
